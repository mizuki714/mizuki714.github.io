                A record-breaking 878,527 ballots were cast in Idaho for the 2020 General Election, which is a turnout
                of 81.2% of Idaho's
                1,082,417 registered voters BOISE, Idaho — Editor's Note: This story was originally published by The
                Idaho Press. The
                official canvass for election 2020 in Idaho is complete, with every ballot now accounted for and
                counted. In Idaho,
                voters broke not one record, not two, but three records this election. A record-breaking 878,527 ballots
                were cast
                in Idaho for the 2020 General Election, which is a turnout of 81.2% of Idaho's 1,082,417 registered
                voters.
                This year's turnout of 81.2% is the highest percentage of voter turnout Idaho has seen for any election
                this century.
                Idahoans also set the record for the most absentee ballots cast in an election ever with 493,719.
                “State and county election officials and workers are to be commended for their dedication, patience and
                flexibility
                in staging a successful general election under the challenging circumstances of a global pandemic,”
                Idaho Secretary
                of State Lawerence Denney said in a statement. “Idahoans cast a record number of ballots, a record
                number of which
                were early or absentee ballots, and produced the highest percentage voter turnout we have seen for any
                election
                this century.” The state Board of Canvassers includes Denney; state Controller Brandon Woolf; and state
                Treasurer
                Julie Ellsworth, who participated in Wednesday’s meeting by phone while the other two attended in
                person.
                The state canvass, conducted after each county has canvassed its results, makes the results of the
                election official.
                All told, a record 878,527 Idahoans cast ballots. More than half — 56.2% —were cast early, either
                through absentee
                voting or in-person early voting. The highest turnout counties, by percentage of registered voters, were
                Fremont,
                88.1%; Kootenai, 87.4%; Butte, 86.3%; and Idaho, 85.1%. The lowest were Madison, 71%; Jerome, 73.9%;
                Clark, 74.9%;
                Latah, 76.2%; and Elmore, 76.9%. Ada County’s final turnout was listed at 81.8% of registered voters;
                Canyon County’s
                was 78.5%. Jason Hancock, deputy secretary of state and elections director, noted that the election set
                a record for
                the number of ballots cast and the number of registered voters, and also for percentage turnout since
                2000. Since then,
                the previous high mark was 77.1% in 2008. According to Idaho Secretary of State’s office records dating
                back to 1980,
                the previous record during that period was 80.46% of registered voters in 1992. Idaho’s turnout is much
                lower when
                calculated as the percentage of the voting-age population casting ballots. In 1992, that figure was
                66.45%;
                in 2016, 59.07%. Hancock said the office hasn’t calculated that figure this year. The 2024 presidential
                election
                will have some tough numbers to beat, but Idaho only has to wait 1,447 days until then.<br> Betsy Z.
